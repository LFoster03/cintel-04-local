# cintel-04-local
## Action 1: Create a GitHub Project Repo
Login to GitHub. Click Repositories. Create a new project repo named cintel-04-local with a default README.md and a default .gitignore for Python. 

Add File: A useful requirements.txt

Use the GitHub web interface to add a file named requirements.txt. For best results, match the spelling and capitalization exactly - and paste in the following packages, one per line as shown below. You may add other packages as you like, for example, some may want to explore AltairLinks to an external site or other interactive chart options as well. 

 

faicons
palmerpenguins
pandas
pyarrow
plotly
seaborn
shiny
shinylive
shinywidgets
 

Add File: app.py - the main Shiny app file
Use the GitHub web interface to add a file named app.py (exactly!). Paste in the content from your P3 Shiny app.py and click Commit to save the file. 

Verify your project repo has all 4 files and that they serve their purpose well:

README.md (note the capitalization)
.gitignore (it's an unusual name, but it must be exactly this)
app.py
requirements.txt
Your code is safely stored in the cloud - you can copy from it (and improve it) as you work through this module and complete Project 4.
